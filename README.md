# Economic Indicator Dashboard

## Description

The Economic Indicator Dashboard is a project inspired by the [U.S. Census Economic Indicators](https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/) website. This project aims to help users visualize and analyze key economic indicators by providing interactive graphs, correlation analysis, and a note-taking feature. The goal is to create a comprehensive tool for analyzing various economic data sources like FRED, World Bank, and IMF.

Currently, this project is a work-in-progress, with features being developed and integrated.

## Tech Stack

- **Front-End**: 
  - React.js
